    summary:
    - Collaborative engineering leader who thrives in high-trust environments with
      fast feedback loops, authentic direction-setting, and clear accountability structures.
      Passionate about learning loops, structured decision-making, and data-informed
      leadership - built Decision Copilot to help teams make better choices together.
      Excels at leading initiatives I believe in and have helped shape, bringing genuine
      conviction rather than organizational theater. Values long-term thinking over
      quarterly theater and fixing root causes over chasing new shiny objects. Requires
      supportive leadership and clear decision frameworks to enable bottom-up innovation.
      Specializes in data reliability engineering, platform SRE, cross-functional
      team leadership, and pioneering work as Principled Context Engineer for AI agent
      orchestration.
